<h3>How it works?</h3>
<p>With Custom Fields MetaBox you can define as many fields you want (2 max for the free version). Once you have defined your custom fields, they will be available int the product edit page, where you can input your data. Only fields with a value will be saved to database.
  <br>
  After editing your Custom Fields for the product they will be displayed in the product single page of your shop.
  <br>
  You can decide if you custom fields have to be added to the description tab or in a new tab with a custom name (only Premium). This options are available in the Custom Fields Metabox Settings.
  <br>
  You can also add custom fields to the single page meta section, setting the flag <code>Product Page Meta</code> to checked.
  <br>
  You can also define your output order dragging the custom fields rows to meet your needs.
</p>
<h3>Import and Optimize DB</h3>
<p>You can import your custom fields using the Woocommerce Import feature.
  <br>
  Your CSV File only needs a column name heading for each custom field in the following format:
  <code>Meta: _cf_[custom_field_slug]</code>
  In the columns mapping select <code>Import as meta</code>
</p>
<p>After importing data you should run the Optimize DB feature in order to clean all records with empty data.
</p>
